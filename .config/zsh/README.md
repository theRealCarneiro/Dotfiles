# ZSH
## Plugins
I don't use any plugin manager, I just source them directly, the plugins I use are:
 - Git Branch
 - Prompt info functions - Colors, ls colors
 - [ZSH vi mode](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode) (with xclip patch)
 - Minimal theme - A theme that I made that uses nerdfont and git plugin

## Completion
The completion directory is used for user made completion scripts
